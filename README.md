# LACare-DataSciencePlatform-RFP-Demo3
This repository contains an R script to demonstrate the solution's ability to develop unsupervised clustering models using popular open source data science libraries.

The "medicare_provider_clustering.R" script is a fully reproducible example to develop and analyze a k-means clustering algorithm on HCPCS code Medicare billing data for a specific provider specialty type in the state of California. The data used is is the "Medicare_Provider_Util_Payment_PUF_CY2015.txt" and can be found at the following link: Â https://www.cms.gov/apps/ama/license.asp?file=http://download.cms.gov/Research-Statistics-Data-and-Systems/Statistics-Trends-and-Reports/Medicare-Provider-Charge-Data/Downloads/Medicare_Provider_Util_Payment_PUF_CY2015.zip

The goal of the script is to identify providers whose billing patterns differ drastically from their specialty peer group. The goal of the demonstration is to assess the solution's ability to install, load, and run libraries that would be leveraged in an actual use-case situation. Specifically, this demonstration will allow L.A. Care to assess the solution on the following Data Science Platform criteria:
- Import, Call, and Development of Open Source Predictive Models
- Feature Generation
- Clustering
- Data Visualization

If capable, vendors are encouraged to demonstrate their solutions' abilities to run the same model and produce similar outputs in a GUI/drag-and-drop type modeling environment (in addition to executing the provided script).
